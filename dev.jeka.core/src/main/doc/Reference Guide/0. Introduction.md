# Introduction

**What is Jeka ?**

Jeka is both a build library, and a thin automation tool. 

The build library helps for dealing with file sets, compilation, dependency management, testing, publishing,
launching external processes, crypto signatures... in a glance, all regular things you need to build/publish projects and especially Java projects. 
The library can be used in any Java program and does not have any dependency.

The tool aims at executing Java **source** code from the command line. Its design eases reuse of build 
elements (logic, settings, doc, ...) across projects. 

Combined, it provides a full feature build tool with endless possibilities of extension.

Although library and tool are bundled in the same jar, the library does not depend on the tool at all.

**What is the purpose ?**

The [reference guide](https://github.com/jerkar/jeka/tree/master/dev.jeka.core/src/main/doc/Reference%20Guide) will provide you:

 * Details about Jeka tool behaviours

**Who is it for ?**

Everyone as a beginner to an expert can utilize the guide if you are interested how Jeka baheaves or want to understand the exhaustive list of Jeka features.

If you are interested to have further details about APIs, please consult Javadoc or source code. Jeka source code has been intelligible written in order to navigate easily from the user code to the Jeka engine room.
