# Welcome to Jeka

_Jeka_ is a general purpose build tool, that is designed as a library + an automation engine. 

Users simply write build logic in Java or Kotlin, then they can invoke their code directly from the command line : Java/Kotlin classes become first class citizen build-scripts !!!

This approach provides several benefits developers love : _flexibility, lightweight, transparency, discoverability_ and _extendability._ 

Beside, Jeka tries to keep cognitive load low, introducing a minimal set of concepts. Good skills in Java/Kotiln should be 
enough to achive builds of any complexity.

Last but not least, _Jeka_ is very lightweight (less than 1Mb) and has zero dependencies, making it friendly to be used as a simple library.
